*-- BYTEBEAT --*

Author: Jamey DeOrio

Description: This simple script allows you to pipe math equations through your audio device to discover algorithmic music.

Dependencies: This script was developed on Mac OS X Lion and requires SoX to work. This is a cross-platform utility, though, so it should hypothetically work on Windows and Linux as well.

SoX -> http://sox.sourceforge.net/

Download the appropriate SoX package and move sox, play, rec, and soxi onto your path.

Usage: Currently, usage is kind of user-unfriendly but still simple enough. Edit the math equation in bytebeat.py to your liking and then run the script and pipe it through sox with the following command:

$ python bytebeat.py | sox -r 8000 -b 8 -c 1 -t raw -s - -d
